* Substantial amounts of deuterium are incorporated into generated methane when source rock is heated in the presence of D2O under hydrothermal conditions.

* Much of the H in thermogenic natural gases may derive from water.

* Gas generation may not be limited by the HI of sedimentary organic matter.
